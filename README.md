# KeyStroker
Arduino sketches for the KeyStroker device.  Used to input random strings as keyboard entries as a keep alive method

Inspiration came from this post on MAKE magazine:  [Awesome Button](http://makezine.com/projects/make-32/the-awesome-button/)

**Materials:**
* Teensy 2.0 Dev board [PJRC](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html)
* SPST Micro toggle switch [Radio Shack](http://www.radioshack.com/spst-micromini-toggle-switch/2750624.html)
* 1K resistor
* Red LED
* Tic-Tac Box
* Mini B USB cable


The first version of this was the KeyStroker I, which I've provided the sketch for.   It was inspired based on this post on the [petRockBlog](http://blog.petrockblock.com/2012/05/19/usb-keyboard-with-arduino-and-v-usb-library-an-example/)
